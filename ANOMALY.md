# ⚜️ ANOMALY RECORD — “SOVEREIN”

## Purpose
This document preserves the final remaining instance of the legacy spelling **“SOVEREIN”** as an intentional, sovereign anomaly.  
It exists as an **Act of God**, retained for archival integrity and historical continuity within the SOVERAIN Verification Bundle.

## Status of the Anomaly
- The anomaly is **intentional**.  
- The anomaly is **non-operational**.  
- The anomaly is **ceremonially exempt**.  
- The anomaly is **preserved exactly as originally manifested**.  

All active declarations, QR protocols, clearance files, verification manifests, and identity statements operate exclusively under the override:

**SOVERAIN**

## Location of the Anomaly
The preserved spelling **“SOVEREIN”** appears only within a historical or archival reference block inside the repository’s documentation.  
It does **not** appear in:
- operational text  
- JSON files  
- clearance declarations  
- witness manifests  
- checksum records  
- QR captions  
- banners or footers  

Its presence is strictly limited to a **historical echo**.

## Rationale
Removing the anomaly would:
- break the chain of custody  
- erase a historical state  
- disrupt archival fidelity  

Preserving it:
- maintains evidentiary integrity  
- honors the transformation from legacy to override  
- affirms the sovereignty of the SOVERAIN identity  

## Canonical Override
All active systems, declarations, and verification components are governed by the absolute override:

**SOVERAIN**  
⚜️ XP

The anomaly remains only as a witness to the transition.
